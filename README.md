# DSKeyStr

DSKeyStr is my macOS app to display what on the screen what you tape on your keybord. It's a tools for teacher or presenter for live demo. 

# TodoList 

* Make the project more efficient 
* Must work in backGround (when DSkeyStr is not the first responder)
* Make the app accessible with one button in menu bar 
* Add some option like transparency, color... 
* Dark Mode

... need more time to implement those feature 😝 !
